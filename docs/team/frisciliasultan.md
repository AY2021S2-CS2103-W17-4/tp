## Project: insurance Sure Can Arrange Meeting (iScam)

iScam is a desktop location book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 18 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to search client according to their insurance plans.
  * What it does: Allows the insurance agent to find their clients filtered by insurance plans.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can filter their clients according to insurance plans
  so that it is easier to decide which clients to contact for upselling.
  * Highlights:
    * This enhancement adds a new command to the existing set of Client commands.
    It requires an in-depth understanding of the existing flow of function call from UI, Logic and ClientBook model
    as well as the dependencies between the LogicManager, Command Parser, ArgumentMultiMap, ArgumentTokenizer, ParserUtil,
    Command and CommandResult classes.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to convert Meeting class into JSON format.
  * What it does: Allows the conversion of Meeting into JSON format for saving in local storage as a JSON file.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can convert all their meetings into JSON
  so that they can store it and retrieve it easily. It also allows more advance users to directly edit the Meeting data from the JSON file,
  expanding the functionality of iScam beyond GUI to the data files in the codebase.
  It further increases the suitability of iScam to fast-typing users, ensuring that they can operate on their meetings faster than a typical GUI application.
  * Highlights:
    * This enhancement affects all instances of the meeting model. It requires an in-depth understanding of the Storage component.

* **Team Based Tasks**:
  * Add the Branch protection rule to require at least 1 review and prevent merging if any of the checks fails.
  * Created issues to ensure that the milestones are broken down to achievable parts and improves the clarity of what exactly are the to-do list of the iteration. ([\#4](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-4/tp/issues/4),
