## Project: insurance Sure Can Arrange Meeting (iScam)

iScam is a desktop application used for insurance agents to keep track of their clients and the meetings that they have. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15.5 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Meetings
  * What it does: Allows the insurance agent to log the meetings they have with their client and track which meeting is coming soon. 
  * Justification: Even though insurance policies can be purchased online, client still prefers the face-to-face interaction and personal touch when purchasing a policy from an agent. So, the agents will oftenly need to meet a client 1-to-1 and to ensure agent don't miss out any meeting, a tracking will be helpful.
  * Highlights: 
      * Introduced a new suite of commands that is similar to the commands from AddressBook-3. Basic commands that adds, delete, edits etc are all enhanced to fit the needs of a meeting and new commands like reschedule and relocate are also added to allow faster usage for the agent.
      * Extended
  * Credits: *Structure of the command suite is adopted from the Person commands from AddressBook-3*
