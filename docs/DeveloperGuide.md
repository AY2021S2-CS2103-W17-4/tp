## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/ClientBook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/ClientBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/location/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/ClientBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/location/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

![Sequence Diagram of the Architecture](images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png)

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.jpg)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/ClientBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/location/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/ClientBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/location/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/ClientBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/ClientBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/location/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `ClientBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a client).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/ClientBook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/location/model/Model.java)

The `Model` component,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the client book and meeting book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` and `Observable<Meeting>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in these lists change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

The `Client` object,

* stores the attributes of a client.
* has `Name` to serve as its unique identifer.

The `Meeting` object,

* stores the attributes of a meeting.
* has `Name` to represent a client's name that is not required to be in the `ClientBook`.
* cannot be created by the user if the `DateTime` is in conflict with another `Meeting`'s `DateTime` or before the date and time at the point of creation.
* has `Name` and `DateTime` to serve as its unique identifier.

### Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2021S2-CS2103-W17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/iscam/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the `ClientBook` data in json format and read it back.
* can save the `MeetingBook` data in json format and read it back.

The `ClientBook` object,
* stores the data of clients
* retrieves stored data of clients

The `MeetingBook` object,
* stores the data of meetings
* retrieves stored data of meetings


### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.iscam.storage` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Client Features
The Client family of features consist of the following features: Add Client, Edit Client, List Clients, 
Find Clients by Name, Find Clients by Insurance Plan and Delete Client.

#### Client Class
The Client class consists of 7 fields, each of the fields represented by its own representative classes. Within those classes,
methods are provided to verify their respective inputs and display error message when the given input is invalid.
This allows the fields to have a low degree of coupling, and we can change how the fields are verifield without affecting
other classes in the App. Additionally, the Client class can be expanded to contain more fields without affecting the
existing features.

Fields
* `Name` - The client's name.
* `Phone` - The client's phone number.
* `Email` - The client's email address.
* `InsurancePlans` - Insurance Plans the client currently holds.
  * A client may have no Insurance Plans.
* `Location` - The client's preferred meeting location.
* `Tags` - Tags associated with the client.
* `ImageRes` - Image of the client.
  * If no image is provided, a default image will be provided by the App.

The `Client` objects are stored in a `UniqueClientList` within `ClientBook`.

#### Add Client
This section will detail the implementation of the Add Client feature via the `add` command.

##### Overview of Add Client Process
The `AddCommand` is executed through entering `add`, followed by valid parameters of the client's name,
phone number, email, preferred meeting location, as well as his/her insurance plans, tags and image, if needed.
The entire command string will be parsed to extract the parameters that were inputted, and if all inputs are valid,
a Client object is constructed which is then added to the Model and saved to the local storage. Upon successful adding,
a feedback message is displayed to the user.

Note
* When given an invalid parameters or no parameters at all, a feedback message will be displayed to the user.

This process is visualised in the diagram below:

![AddCommand activity diagram](images/AddClientActivityDiagram.png)

##### AddCommand
`AddCommand` is inherited from the `Command` class and overrides its `execute()` method to initiate the
creation of a client, addition to the model and saving to the local storage. Through the inheritance from `Command`, the
`Logic` component can deal with `AddCommand` as if it is just a `Command` through polymorphism, further reducing
coupling.

##### Detailed Execution Pathway
The diagram below details how the user's command to add a meeting propagates through the system to eventually add a
meeting.

![AddCommand sequence diagram](images/AddClientSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Find Client by Name
This section will detail the implementation of the Find Client by Name feature via the `find` command.

##### Overview of Find Client by Name Process
The `FindCommand` is executed through entering `find` followed by full keywords to return a filtered list
to be displayed by the UI. The entire command string will be parsed to extract the keywords that were inputted and
form a predicate that requires a client to match all the keywords in order to pass. This predicate is then used to
filter the meeting list in the model and display the filtered list onto the UI. Upon successful filtering, a success
message is displayed to the user.

Note
* When no keywords are provided, a feedback message will be displayed to the user.

This process is visualised in the diagram below:

![FindCommand activity diagram](images/FindClientByNameActivityDiagram.png)

##### FindCommand
Similar to the `AddCommand` class, `FindCommand` is inherited from `Command` class and overrides its `execute()`
method to initiate the search and filtering of the displayed list of Clients in the App's UI. Through the
inheritance from `Command`, the `Logic` component can deal with `FindCommand` as if it were just a `Command` through
polymorphism, further reducing coupling.

##### Detailed Execution Pathway
The diagram below details how the user's command to find clients by their names propagates through the system to
eventually displays the matching clients to the user.

![FindCommand sequence diagram](images/FindClientSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Delete Client
This section will detail the implementation of the Delete Client feature via the `delete` command.

##### Overview of DeleteClient Process
The `DeleteCommand` is executed through entering `delete`, followed by the index of the client on the entire list
displayed by the UI. The entire command string will be parsed to extract the index that was entered and identify the
client to be deleted from `UniqueClientList` within `ClientBook`. Subsequently, the new `UniqueClientList` is saved to
local storage.

Note
* When an invalid index is provided, a feedback message will be displayed to the user.

This process is visualised in the diagram below:

![DeleteCommand activity diagram](images/DeleteClientActivityDiagram.png)

##### DeleteCommand
Similar to the `AddCommand` class, `DeleteCommand` is inherited from `Command` class and overrides its `execute()`
method to initiate the search and delete the client from the `UniqueClientList` within `ClientBook`. Through the 
inheritance from `Command`, the `Logic` component can deal with `DeleteCommand` as if it were just a `Command` through
polymorphism, further reducing coupling.

##### Detailed Execution Pathway
The diagram below details how the user's command to delete a client propagates through the system to eventually
remove the matching client from the App.

![DeleteCommand sequence diagram](images/DeleteClientSequenceDiagram.png)

### Meeting Features
The Meeting family of features consist of the following features: Add Meeting, Edit Meeting, List Meetings,
Find Meetings, Reschedule Meeting, Relocate Meeting, Complete Meeting and Delete Meeting.

#### Meeting Class
The Meeting class consists of 6 fields, each of the fields represented by its own respective classes. Within those classes, 
methods are provided to verify their respective inputs and display error message when the given input is invalid.
This allows the fields to have a low degree of coupling, and we can change how the fields are verified without affecting
other classes in the App. Additionally, the Meeting class can be expanded to contain more fields without affecting the 
existing fields.

Fields
* `ClientName` - Name of the client involved in the meeting.
  * The client referred here does not need to be in the ClientBook.
* `DateTime` - Date and time when the meeting take place.
* `Location` - Location where the meeting take place.
* `Description` - General description of what the meeting is about.
* `Tags` - Tagging the type of meeting it is.
* `CompletionStatus` - Status of the meeting, whether if it is completed or not.

The `Meeting` objects are stored in a `UniqueMeetingList` within `MeetingBook`.

#### Add Meeting
This section will detail the implementation of the Add Meeting feature via the `addmeet` command.

##### Overview of Adding Process
The `AddMeetingCommand` is executed through entering `addmeet` followed by valid parameters of the client's name,
date and time, location and any tags if needed. The entire command string will be parsed to extract the parameters that 
were inputted and if they are all valid, a Meeting object is constructed and added to the Model and saved to the local
storage. Upon successful adding, a feedback message is displayed to the user.

Note
* When given an invalid parameters or no parameters at all, a feedback message will be displayed to the user.

This process is visualised in the diagram below:

![AddMeetingCommand activity diagram](images/AddMeetingActivityDiagram.png)

##### AddMeetingCommand
The `AddMeetingCommand` is inherited from the `Command` class and overrides its `execute()` method to initiate the 
creation of meeting, addition to the model and saving to the local storage. Through the inheritance from `Command`, the
`Logic` component can deal with `AddMeetingCommand` as if it is just a `Command` through polymorphism, further reducing
coupling.

##### Detailed execution pathway
The diagram below details how the user's command to add a meeting propagates through the system to eventually add a
meeting.

![AddMeetingCommand sequence diagram](images/AddMeetingSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Edit Meeting
This section will detail the implementation of the Edit Meeting feature via the `editmeet` command.

##### Overview of Editing process
The `EditMeetingCommand` is executed through entering `editmeet` followed by valid parameters of the displayed index of
the meeting and any fields of a meeting that is going to be modified. The entire command string will be parsed to 
extract the parameters that were inputted and if they are all valid, the Meeting object in the Model that corresponds
to the displayed index will be modified and replaced the original one in the Model and local storage. Upon successful
editing, a feedback message is displayed to the user.

Note. 
* When there are issues with the parameters or the meeting to modify is already completed, a feedback message will be 
  displayed to the user 
* When the edited meeting's date-time collides with an existing meeting in the model, a conflict message will be 
  displayed to the user.

This process is visualised in the diagram below:

![EditMeetingCommand activity diagram](images/EditMeetingActivityDiagram.png)

##### EditMeetingCommand
Similar to the `AddMeetingCommand`, `EditMeetingCommand` is inherited from `Command` class and overrides its `execute()`
method to initiate the modification of an existing meeting, updating the model and local storage. 

##### Detailed execution pathway
The diagram below details how the user's command to edit a meeting propagates through the system to eventually edit a 
meeting.

![EditMeetingCommand sequence diagram](images/EditMeetingSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Find Meeting
This section will detail the implementation of the Find Meeting feature via the `findmeet` command.

##### Overview of Finding Process
The `FindMeetingCommand` is executed through entering `findmeet` followed by partial, full or unique keywords to return 
a list of filtered meetings to be displayed by the UI. The entire command string will be parsed to extract the keywords
that were inputted and form a predicate that require a meeting to match all the keywords in order to pass. This
predicate is then used to filter the meeting list in the model and display the filtered list onto the UI. Upon successful
filtering, a success message is displayed to the user.

Note
* When no keywords are provided, a feedback message will be displayed to the user.
* When no meetings are found, a failure message is displayed to the user.

This process is visualised in the diagram below:

![FindMeetingCommand activity diagram](images/FindMeetingActivityDiagram.png)

##### FindMeetingCommand
Similar to the `AddMeetingCommand`, `FindMeetingCommand` is inherited from `Command` class and overrides its `execute()`
method to initiate the search and filtering of the displayed list in the UI.

##### Detailed execution pathway
The diagram below details how the user's command to find meetings propagates through the system to eventually displays 
the matching meetings to the user.

![FindMeetingCommand sequence diagram](images/FindMeetingSequenceDiagram.png)

### Customisation Features

#### Profile picture for clients
The application stores the names of the profile images for each client in the `ClientBook` in the model.
The ClientDetailFragment UI class has access to an `ObservableClient` object owned by the model.
Whenever the profile image needs to be displayed or updated, the ClientDetailFragment is updated
through the ObservableClient.

The ClientDetailFragment UI class directly accesses the `'data'` folder and attempts to load the
image as an asset in the UI. If the asset cannot be found, the UI then loads the default image
instead.

## Effort
iScam is a product that has been developed from AddressBook Level 3. While AddressBook is a generic contact storing product, iScam is more targeted towards Insurance Agents, allowing them to keep track of their clients and meetings.

Our group spent 6 weeks to develop iScam, releasing 4 versions in the process. 
1. Version 1.1 of iScam was completed in Week 7, and it included updating the content of the User Guide, Developer's Guide, About Us and README page.
2. Version 1.2 of iScam was completed in Week 8 and 9, the Meeting and MeetingList classes were added, an Insurance Plan attribute was added to the Client class, and the references to AddressBook were all replaced with ClientBook.
3. Version 1.3 of iScam was completed in Week 10 and 11, and this version saw a transformation of the User Interface, introducing a Meeting List Panel alongside the Client List Panel. In addition to that, a Client Detail Fragment section was added, allowing the user to see client details easily.
4. Version 1.4 of iScam was completed in Week 12, and focused on fixing the bugs presented to us in the Practical Exam Dry Run. A major change was to show Client List, Client Details and Meeting List all at once in the UI. <br>

One of the main challenges we faced was the understanding of the code. In the AddressBook given, there was a lot of classes, packages and code to digest. Our group needed a few weeks to adjust to the code given, and fully understand how the code works.<br>

This resulted in our v1.2 to be less than ideal, as a significant amount of time was spent on digesting the code, rather than actually making changes.<br>

The effort required is relatively similar to that of the Individual Project, as evidenced by the much more advanced GUI, testing and User/Developer's Guide.
